# Advanced Wireless Configuration

## Overview
This focuses on configuring, securing, and optimizing a wireless network using advanced wireless technologies such as **Wi-Fi 6, mesh networking, and security protocols**. Students will simulate real-world challenges and implement best practices to enhance wireless performance.

## Objectives
- Configure a **Wi-Fi 6** network with seamless coverage.
- Implement **mesh networking** for extended connectivity.
- Secure the network using **WPA3 encryption, MAC filtering, and guest access restrictions**.
- Optimize network performance to **reduce interference and prioritize critical devices**.
- Troubleshoot and resolve wireless connectivity issues.

## Requirements
- **Software**: Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, or physical hardware.
- **Devices**: Wireless routers/APs, client devices (laptops, smartphones, IoT devices).
- **Tools**:
  - **Ping & Traceroute** for connectivity testing.
  - **Heatmap analysis** for signal coverage.
  - **Traffic monitoring tools** for network performance evaluation.

## Setup
### Step 1: **Basic Wireless Configuration**
- Set up a primary AP with **SSID: TechConnect_Office**.
- Configure a **guest network (SSID: TechConnect_Guest)** with bandwidth restrictions.
- Secure networks with **WPA3 encryption**.

### Step 2: **Advanced Wireless Features**
- Enable **Wi-Fi 6 (MU-MIMO, OFDMA)** on the main AP.
- Implement **mesh networking** with two additional APs.
- Configure **channel management (1,6,11) to reduce interference**.

### Step 3: **Security Enhancements**
- **Enable MAC filtering** for authorized devices.
- Restrict guest network access to **5 Mbps** with no internal network access.
- **Set up network segmentation** to isolate IoT devices from critical data.

### Step 4: **Testing and Troubleshooting**
- Verify **network connectivity using ping and traceroute**.
- Simulate a **misconfigured SSID or overlapping channels** and resolve the issue.
- Use **signal strength analysis** to optimize AP placement.
